### Big Three
```
   •	Minitaur Programming
   •	K9 ISR NoIR Camera
   •	K9 ISR IR LED
```

### Objective
  Continue development of K9 ISR Camera, order IR LED

### Work I Did
   This week, I finished initial development of the K9 ISR camera. The camera now boots and loads the PiCamera script upon startup, and
   can see very well under low-light conditions. However, I still want to add an IR LED and develop a case. 

### Meetings
   •	I met with Brian to discuss the ordering of the IR LED.

### Summary/Remarks:
   •	Pi Camera set up for Night vision, IR LED ordered
   •	Picamera boots up upon starting the raspberry pi
   •	Work developing case now underway

### Follow up
   •	Create custom case and integrate IR into K9 ISR camera, order IR LEDs
   •	Research best way to run IR LED with new Raspberry pi case
